# how to use
#### 1. get the following fonts: [slant](https://www.ffonts.net/Slant.font) and [russel square regular](https://google.com/search?q=russel+square+regular+font+free+download)
#### 2. use illustrator file to make the main part of logo

  0. [get the original logo in as a ref](https://remywiki.com/images/2/29/SDVX_VIVID_WAVE.png)
  1. type main part in slant
  2. convert them into outlines and try make one of the character imitate the style of V in voltex (good thing is slant always goes straight or 45 degrees diagonal so you can just use direct selection, select 2 anchors and drag and hold shift)
  3. after that duplicate them; make one of them red, another blue. make the one that goes in front use multiply blend mode in the transparency panel
  4. offset them by a little bit
  5. make the pink part (protip: use slant's I to make bars)
  6. change the acronym under tsumabuki into something else
  7. make thin line under "slogan"
  7. asset export the main part, slogan line & tsumabuki (if you are really lazy, you can do it at @4x but beware pc burning up lol. if you're not exporting at @4x export the 3 colored arrows too)
#### 3. use photoshop file to finalize it (beware pc burning up)
  0. maybe take in the ref in again if you want
  1. replace the old kshoot logo with yours in the nested folders of strokes
  2. replace old slogan line with yours
  3. type in your slogan
  4. move/replace 3 colored arrows to where they should be
  5. if you didn't export at @4x, set the strokes accordingly
  6. remove old tsumabuki folder
  7. place your new tsumabuki in, copy & paste it in a grid pattern til the grid of them is larger then your logo
  8. dump the tsumabuki layers in a folder
  9. set blending mode as screen
  10. hide the folder, use magic wand, select black border around logo(if it eats into white, no probs), make mask on folder and show it
  
done i guess
