so i made it react to music, but only for tube side. and also you can now spawn data inside the tubes.

keybinds profile for watch_dogs 2

color | meaning
--- | ---
red | movement stuff
orange | interact
yellow | multiplayer stuff
green | hacky stuff
magenta | deploy
white | smartphone
breathing | apps! yes i painstakingly got the colors of the apps to put it on keys

pretty much the reason i did this is because i bought watch_dogs 2 now and i had a keybinds profile for it back when synapse 2 and i pirated wd2 to play it
