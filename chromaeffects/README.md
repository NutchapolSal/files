color | meaning

red | movement stuff

yellow | multiplayer stuff
green | hacky stuff
magenta | deploy
white | smartphone
breathing | apps! yes i painstakingly got the colors of the apps to put it on keys

pretty much the reason i did this is because i bought watch_dogs 2 now and i had a keybinds profile for it back when synapse 2 and i pirated wd2 to play it
